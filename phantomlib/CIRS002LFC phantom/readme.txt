The CIRS Model 002LFC IMRT Thorax Phantom for Film and Ion chamber Dosimetry is designed to address the complex issues surrounding commissioning and comparison of treatment planning systems while providing a simple yet reliable method for verification of individual patient plans and delivery. The 002LFC is elliptical in shape and properly represents an average human torso in proportion, density and two-dimensional structure. It measures 30 cm long x 30 cm wide x 20 cm thick. The phantom is constructed of proprietary tissue equivalent epoxy materials. Linear attenuations of the simulated tissues are within 1% of actual attenuation for water and bone, and within 3% for lung from 50 keV to 25 MeV.
